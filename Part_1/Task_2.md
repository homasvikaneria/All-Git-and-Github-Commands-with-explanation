### **Task 2: Initialize a Repository**
1. Create a new project folder and navigate to it: 
   ```bash
   mkdir myproject
   ```
   This will create a new folder called myproject

2. Initialize it as a Git repository:
   ```bash 
   git init
   ```
    After running `git init`, a hidden `.git` folder will appear in the directory, indicating itâ€™s now under version control.
